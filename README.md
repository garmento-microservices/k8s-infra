# k8s-infra

Kubernetes-based infrastructure-as-code for GARMENTO system. Migrated from the [original monorepo](https://github.com/binhdoitsme/garmento/tree/main/infrastructure/prod).

## Notes

* Currently, we are using containerized databases. We should and will change to use external databases later on.
* We will also enforce the use of K8s secrets.
